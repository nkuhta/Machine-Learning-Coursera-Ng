1.  Source code found in the **.../machine-learning-ex5/ex5** file path
2.  **Run_main_ex5.m** 	- Primary run file.  
3.  **linearRegCostFunction.m** 	- Regularized Cost and Gradient function for Linear Regression.  Note this is also generalized to handle polynomials. 
4.  **trainLinearReg.m** 	- Given initial theta minimize the cost function using fmincg
5.  **learningCurve.m** 	- Calculate training and validation error for the range of m training values.  
6.  **polyFeatures.m** 	- Maps mx1 X vector to a mxp matrix, where the column p (mx1) vector has values X^p.  
7.  **featureNornalize.m** 	- standard deviation normalize an array about the mean. 
8.  **validationCurve.m** 	- compute error_train and error_val as lambda changes.
