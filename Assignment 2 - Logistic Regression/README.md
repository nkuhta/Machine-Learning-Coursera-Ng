#   Assignment 2 - Logistic Regression	
1.  Source code found in the **.../machine-learning-ex2/ex2** file path
2.  **run_main_ex2.m** 	- Primary run file - Loading and plotting logistic data,  
3.  **plotData.m**	- Find positive and negative data row index values and plot catagorical logistic data.
4.  **costFunction.m** - Compute the cost and gradient (for each theta) for logistic regression model. 
5.  **sigmoid.m** - sigmoid exponential function.  
6.  **plotDecisionBoundary.m** - Plot the decision boundary using optimized theta, for some (x,y) logistic data.
7.  **predict.m** - Sigmoid probability prediction for a set of test values, computing the accuracy of the training set.   
8.  **run_main_ex2_reg.m** - Primary run file for regularized higher order polynomial logistic regression.  Compute cost, gradient, decision boundary, and training set accuracy.  
9.  **mapFeature.m** - Take a 2 column x value array and create the polynomial combinations of the x values up to some set degree.
10. **costFunctionReg.m** - Compute the regularized cost and gradient values.
